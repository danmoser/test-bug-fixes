Contributing to a GitHub project 
============

This tutorial will help with the following situation: when you are proposing changes to someone else's repo for which you do not have write permissions.

TL;DR: how to pull request or fix bugs in someone else's project.

# Tasks

### 1. fork this repo

i.e. create your own copy of this.

### 2. clone locally your fork

### 3. sync your fork with the original repo



4. create a branch for your edits
5. open *source.txt* and each person fixes a specific error in the "source code"
6. create the pull request: contribute your bug fix to the code
